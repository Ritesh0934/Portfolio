Ritesh Pagar – Portfolio Website

Live site

🚀 About

Hello! I’m Ritesh Pagar — a passionate and self-taught web developer from India who loves turning creative ideas into functional and beautiful websites. I enjoy working with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap on the frontend, and Python & Django on the backend.
My journey began with curiosity about how websites are built, and that curiosity quickly grew into a deep interest in coding and design.
I believe every website should tell a story through its design — not just look good, but feel intuitive and meaningful.
Beyond coding, I spend time learning new tools, improving my problem-solving skills, and exploring ways to blend creativity with technology.
My ultimate goal is to grow as a developer, build real-world projects, and contribute to something that makes a difference in the digital world.
